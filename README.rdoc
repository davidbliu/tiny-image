This project helps collaborators share photos and videos without unnecessarily sending large files over the internet

The steps are:
1. collaborators each run the uploader, which compresses their photo/video library and sends it to app
2. collaborators use app to preview photos and select the ones they want to share
3. app shows each collaborator which photos they should upload in full
4. collaborators upload photos in full
5. profit
